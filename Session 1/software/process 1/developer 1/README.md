# Agent0

## Agent0 is a automation script written by me
It automates the process of sending regular meeting invites for montly,weekly events

 It updates the status in multiple places like mailing list, Blog and the Tamil linux community forum 

 For now Tamil linux community forum will be updated for Monthly meetings only.

 If you are interested in contributing to the script, just fork it, update it and raise PR 

 I tried to write this automation in a modular way so even individual python files can be re-used in your projects
